# Simple DiscordBot

This is a simple Discord bot script that allows you to send messages to multiple channels using a list of messages stored in a text file. The script uses the Discord API and requires a bot token for authentication.

## Features

- Send messages from multiple account to multiple Discord channels.
- Customize message delays and token processing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries: `requests`, `PyYAML`, `colorama`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the script):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/recitativonika/Discord-auto-chat-py.git
    cd Discord-auto-chat-py
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Edit `config.yaml` file** in the same directory as the script with the following structure:
    ```yaml
    token:
      - "your_token_1"
      - "your_token_2"
    channel_id:
      - "channel_id_1"
      - "channel_id_2"
      - "channel_id_3"
    token_delay: 5  # Delay for each token processing in seconds
    message_delay: 2  # Delay for each message sent in seconds
    restart_delay: 10  # Delay before restarting the bot in seconds
    send_mode: "bulk"  # Options: "random" or "bulk"
    ```
    Get the token for your discord account with this, pasten in url bar when you open discord web
    ```
    javascript:var i = document.createElement('iframe');i.onload = function(){var localStorage = i.contentWindow.localStorage;prompt('Your discord token', localStorage.getItem('token').replace(/["]+/g, ''));};document.body.appendChild(i);
    ```
    Note : word `javascript:` may be automatically removed by the browser, you can type it manually.

4. **Edit the `chat.txt` file** with the messages you want the bot to send. Each message should be on a new line.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python discord.py
    ```

2. **Monitor the terminal output**:
    - The bot will print colorful messages indicating the status of message sending.
    - If any errors occur, they will be displayed in red.

3. **Customize your configuration**:
    - You can modify the `config.yaml` file to add more tokens, channel IDs, and adjust delays as needed.

## Example `chat.txt`

Your `chat.txt` file might look like this:

   ```
   Hello there!
   How's it going?
   This is a random message.
   Have a great day!
   ```

## Notes

- Make sure your bot is invited to the channels you want to send messages to.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to send messages in those channels.
